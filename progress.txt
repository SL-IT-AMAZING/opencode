## Iteration 1 - US-001: Add Preview Tab Helpers to File Context
- Implemented three preview tab helper functions in `packages/app/src/context/file.tsx`
- Files changed: `packages/app/src/context/file.tsx`
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Follow existing patterns: `tab()` and `pathFromTab()` show the encoding/decoding pattern
  - Functions go inside the `init()` function and are added to the return object
  - Preview tab format: `preview://url:<url>` for http/https URLs, `preview://file:<path>` for files
  - Use `normalize(input)` for file paths to ensure consistent paths
