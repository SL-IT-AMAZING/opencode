## Planning with Files

For complex multi-step tasks, use the **planning-with-files** skill to maintain persistent context:

1. **task_plan.md** - Track project phases and progress with checkboxes
2. **notes.md** - Store research findings and accumulated knowledge
3. **[deliverable].md** - Final output or project result

Use this approach when:

- Working on tasks with multiple phases
- Needing to track progress across sessions
- Building features that require research and planning
